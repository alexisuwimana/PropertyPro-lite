                <p>My Houseâ€™s beginnings go back to 2000 when CSU Alumni and owner Kris, saw a need for a culture change in property management. She left corporate America to become self-employed, managing a handful of homes for an individual investor, and revolutionized the climate by creating a more customer-focused model. In 2007, she incorporated and debuted as My House Property Services, and acquired over a hundred more properties in Fort Collins and surrounding cities. Today, My House has grown to over 300 properties and into a fully integrated real estate firm that specializes in property management, maintenance, and investment consulting. My House is the premier choice for your Northern Colorado property management and maintenance needs.</p>

Some of my best memories have been made in the places you have leased to me and I felt that you all at My House should know that.
